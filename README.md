# Sexy Codicology Plugin
The Sexy Codicology Plugin is a Chrome plugin that queries the DMMapp data and lets you find digitized medieval manuscript repositories on the fly!

## Why a plugin?
We want to make it as easy as possible for researchers to reach digitized repositories. With this objective in mind, we wanted to create a tool that could fit in their workflow and reduce clicks needed to reach digitized manuscripts.

A Chrome Plugin seemed to be the most efficient way to achieve this.

Skip having to navigate to the website first; just click the plugin and type the institution you are searching for. The handy autocomplete will also help you get there faster.

Missing a repository? As always, let us know!

## Is there a difference between the data in the DMMapp's website and this plugin?
No, it is the same.

## Plugin history
We had in mind to create this plugin for a while, but we did not have the time to get to it. Recently Giulio came to develop the "Library Search Assistant" for Leiden University Libraries; this gave him the opportunity to learn a couple of tricks, and how Chrome Extensions work. Once that project was completed, he took what he had learned there and used it here.
